There are 16 tanks that are sort of in 4 blocks (in groupings of tanks 1-4, 5-8, 9-12, and 13-16; but I wouldn't be surprised if there really isn't a block effect). 

In each of the 4 blocks there is:
1 tank with 1 initially uninfected adult frog + 5 infected tadpoles
1 tank with 4 initially uninfected adult frog + 5 infected tadpoles
1 tank with 8 initially uninfected adult frog + 5 infected tadpoles
1 tank with 16 initially uninfected adult frog + 5 infected tadpoles

The adult frogs are uniquely identifiable with pittags, but we couldn't mark the tadpoles, so the 5 tadpoles in each tank are indistinguishable.

We swabbed all individuals in each tank every week, but it took 2 days to do each set of sampling, so the sample events aren't exactly 1 week apart.  
In the datafile, ZE is the Bd load measured in zoospore equivalents on the frog.

The swab_id's mean the following:
for frogs:  
MDF1_4_JUL20 MDF= Mesocosm Density Frog
1= Tank 1
4= Frog 4 (Tank and Frog together uniquely identifies the individual for frogs)
Jul20 = date in 2008

for tadpoles (initially tadpoles; many went through metamorphosis during the experiment, but we continued to use this labelling): 
MDT7_5_Aug5 MDT= Mesocosm Density Tadpole
7= Tank 7
5= Tadpole 5 (Tank and frog + date was used to match up the PCR results with the individual characteristics (e.g. gosner stage) for the swab.  Because the tadpoles are not tagged, 7_5 does not  refer to the same individual in tank 7 on every sampling date.)
Aug 5 = date in 2008.

The first few adult frogs that died were replaced with surplus uninfected frogs because we were initially trying to maintain the frog densities (that's why, e.g. there is a frog 1_17 in tank 1), but no replacements were made after that. 

Let me know if you have any questions. 
Thanks,
